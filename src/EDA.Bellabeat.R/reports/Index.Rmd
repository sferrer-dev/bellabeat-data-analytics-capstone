This **Coursera Capstone Project** focuses on analyzing the **Fitabase dataset (03/12/2016–11/04/2016)**, which contains activity, sleep, and wellness data collected from Fitbit device users from the manufacturer Bellabeat. The goal of this project is to apply the full analytical workflow — data preparation, transformation, exploration, and visualization — to uncover meaningful trends and generate insights that can support Bellabeat, a company specializing in health-focused smart devices. This analysis forms the final practical assessment of the Google Data Analytics Certification.

# Using the `render_all.R` {.unnumbered}

To streamline the automated build process of this analysis, the project includes a dedicated rendering script located at:

```
scripts/render_all.R
```

This script performs three key tasks:

1. **Builds the complete HTML website** associated with all reports inside the `reports/` folder.
2. **Generates English and French Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)** based on the corresponding R Markdown files.
3. **Organizes all outputs into their appropriate directories**.

The HTML site is produced in:

```
reports/output/
```

The Jupyter notebooks are generated in:

```
notebooks/
```

---

## **Generation of `.ipynb` Notebooks** {.unnumbered}

---

As part of the build workflow, the script automatically converts each R Markdown file matching the naming pattern:

```
XX_ReportName.Rmd  
XX_ReportName_FR.Rmd
```

into structured Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`).

### **Process overview** {.unnumbered}

* Quarto is used to render each `.Rmd` file into `.ipynb` format.
* Notebooks are first created temporarily inside `reports/`.
* They are then moved into the main output directory:

```
notebooks/
```

separated into English and French versions depending on file naming conventions (`_FR.Rmd` vs non-FR).

These notebooks can be opened locally, reviewed in JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook, or uploaded directly to Kaggle as public notebooks accompanying the HTML analytical reports.

---

## **How to execute the rendering script from RStudio** {.unnumbered}

---

1. Open the RStudio console.
2. Run the following command:

```r
source(here::here("scripts", "render_all.R"))
```

Executing this command triggers the full build process:

* HTML site generation
* `.ipynb` notebook generation
* Output organization across both `reports/output/` and `notebooks/`

After completion, the console displays a summary of all generated artifacts.
