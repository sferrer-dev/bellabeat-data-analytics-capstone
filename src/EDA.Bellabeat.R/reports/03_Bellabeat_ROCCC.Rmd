# **R**eliability (Data reliability)

The reliability of the Fitabase/Bellabeat data is **overall moderate**, with several limitations.

## Strengths

- **Data collected from real devices** (Fitbit), therefore objective measurements: no self-reporting.
- **Consistent timestamping** across the minute-by-minute, hourly and daily files.
- **No critical missing values** in time columns and user identifiers.
- **Rich granularity**: minute, hour, day → suitable for time-series analysis and pattern detection.

## Weaknesses

- **Very small sample: only 30 users**, which strongly limits generalizability.
- **Uneven distribution of user contributions**: some users provide a lot of heart-rate data, others almost none (e.g. `heartrate_seconds_merged`).
- **Imbalance in some metrics**:
    - `minuteMETsNarrow_merged`: extremely skewed distribution;
    - `weightLogInfo_merged`: very low coverage → potential bias.
- **Data collected over a short period** (31 days) → no annual seasonality.

> **Reliability conclusion** – Sufficient for an educational exploratory project, not strong enough to support robust *market research* recommendations.

# **O**riginality (Uniqueness / analytical value)

## What the data allows us to analyse

- **Circadian patterns** thanks to the minute- and hour-level files.
- **Global behavioural analysis**: activity, sleep, calories, heart rate.
- **Multi-granularity combination** → rare and valuable for modelling a typical day.
- **Possibility to reconstruct a complete user journey**:
    - sleep → wake-up;
    - activity / intensity → calories → METs → daily behaviour.

## Limitations

- No socio-demographic variables → no profile-based analyses (age, gender, generalizable BMI, etc.).

> **Originality conclusion** – The diversity of detail levels is the main strength of this dataset.

# **C**omprehensiveness (Coverage / functional scope)

## Analytical coverage provided by the 11 files

| Area                    | Coverage level | Comment                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily activity          | **High**       | `dailyActivity`, `dailyIntensities`, `dailySteps` → complete global view. |
| Hourly activity         | **Very high**  | `hourlyCalories`, `hourlyIntensities`, `hourlySteps` → robust circadian analyses. |
| Minute-level activity   | **Very high**  | Fine granularity for modelling or detecting activity peaks.            |
| Calories / energy expenditure | **High** | `minuteCaloriesNarrow` + `hourlyCalories` → consistent measurement over time. |
| METs (physiological intensity) | **High** | Rare metric but highly skewed.                                         |
| Sleep                   | **Moderate**   | `minuteSleep_merged` → good level of detail but no sleep stages.       |
| Heart rate              | **Low**        | `heartrate_seconds_merged` incomplete depending on the user.           |
| Weight / BMI            | **Very low**   | `weightLogInfo_merged` almost unusable for global analyses.            |

## Temporal comprehensiveness

- **31 days** → sufficient for:
    - daily patterns;
    - behavioural clustering;
    - habit quantification.
- **Insufficient** for:
    - seasonality;
    - long-term behaviour change.

> **Comprehensiveness conclusion** – High for activity, moderate for sleep, low for heart rate and weight/BMI.

# **C**itation (Documentation / traceability / reproducibility)

## Strengths

- Clearly named files.
- Homogeneous columns across files (`Id`, `dateTime`, `value`).
- Fitabase documentation is publicly available.

## Weaknesses

- No metadata embedded in the files.
- No device identifiers → loss of contextual information.
- No complete official README.

> **Citation conclusion** – Intrinsically weak at the raw file level; improved only through project documentation.

---

# **C**urrency (Data recency)

The data dates back to **2016**.

## Consequences

- 2016 Fitbit devices → significant **technological bias**.
- Health guidelines, activity recommendations and intensity classifications have evolved since then.
- User behaviour has changed (more smartphone integration, more modern sensors).

> **Currency conclusion** – Weak for operational decision-making, but adequate for an academic or training-oriented analytics project.

# Final ROCCC Summary {.unnumbered}

## Strengths

- Exceptionally rich granularity (minute → hour → day).
- Temporal consistency.
- Real, non self-reported data.
- High potential for behavioural analysis and segmentation.
- Dataset well-suited for practising EDA, cleaning, profiling, clustering and circadian analysis.

## Weaknesses

- Sample size too small (30 users → low statistical reliability).
- Old data (2016).
- Strongly skewed distributions for METs, intensity and minute-level calories.
- No demographic variables.

## Overall conclusion

The 11 Bellabeat files provide an **excellent learning ground for data analytics**: profiling, EDA, quality checks, ETL integration, visualisation, segmentation, and building an analytical narrative.

However, they are **too limited** for real-world decision-making, mainly because of:

- the small sample size;
- the lack of user diversity;
- the age of the data.
